# Interactive-Decision-Tree

## Overview
This project is a simple interactive decision tree that guides users through a series of choices and provides personalized recommendations based on their inputs. The user selects preferences through dropdown menus, and the app dynamically generates and displays the result.

## Features
- Dynamic content generation using vanilla JavaScript.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.
- CSS animations for better user engagement.
- Well-structured code with reusable functions for scalability.

## How It Works
1. The user answers three questions:
   - Preference for mountains or the beach.
   - Interest in adventure or relaxation.
   - Budget level (Low, Medium, High).
2. Based on the inputs, the app generates a recommendation.
3. The result is displayed in a styled box with a smooth fade-in animation.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

**Research**
 - Explored JavaScript techniques for dynamically generating text based on user inputs.
 - Reviewed CSS animation techniques to enhance UI interactivity.
 - Studied responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across devices.

**Improvements**
 - Add more detailed and diversified recommendations based on additional user inputs.
 - Use local storage to save the user's preferences for future sessions.
 - Implement more advanced animations or transitions.
 - Refactor the code to use a lightweight JavaScript framework (e.g., Vue.js or React) for better scalability.
 - Extend the project to include an API for fetching dynamic travel recommendations.
